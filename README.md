# Introduction
The GitHub Archive Data Engineering and Analytics project aims to transform raw [GitHub](https://www.gharchive.org/) event data into meaningful insights about platform usage and activity trends. GitHub, as a leading platform for version control and collaboration, generates vast amounts of data daily, encompassing millions of user interactions, repository contributions, and events. This project captures, processes, and analyzes this data to provide valuable information, including user engagement levels, the most active repositories, bot identification, popular event types, and daily commit patterns. By developing a robust data pipeline and analytics framework, this project enables stakeholders to gain deeper insights into how GitHub is utilized, revealing trends in developer activity, popular project contributions, and overall platform health. The resulting data-driven insights support product, engineering, and community initiatives aimed at improving the GitHub experience for developers worldwide.

# Objective
The main objective of this project is as below:
- Develop an efficient data engineering pipeline using PySpark to extract data from a web API and ingest it into Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
- Transform and load raw data from GCS into Google BigQuery as the data warehousing solution.
- Use dbt Cloud to transform raw data into a star schema and create materialized views based on this schema for optimized analysis.
- Visualize the data using Looker, leveraging materialized views for enhanced performance and insights.

# Architectural Solution

The diagram below illustrates the architectural solution designed utilizing cloud technologies. This architecture is optimized for handling millions of rows through batch processing, ensuring efficiency and scalability. Additionally, it is a cost-effective solution, leveraging cloud capabilities to minimize operational expenses while maximizing performance.

Terraform is utilized as an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, enabling the automated creation and management of cloud resources, including Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets and BigQuery tables. By defining infrastructure configurations in code, Terraform facilitates consistent and repeatable deployments, enhancing collaboration and reducing manual errors.

Prefect serves as the workflow orchestration tool in this architecture, streamlining the execution and monitoring of data workflows. It allows for the creation of complex data pipelines with built-in error handling and retry mechanisms, ensuring that tasks are executed in the correct order and can be easily monitored.

In the next section, we will explore additional tools and technologies that complement this architecture

# Data Pipeline

A data pipeline is a series of data processing steps that automate the movement and transformation of data from various sources to a destination, typically a data warehouse or data lake. It ensures that data is collected, processed, and made available for analysis in a timely and efficient manner, allowing organizations to derive insights and make informed decisions based on up-to-date information.

- Ingestion: This pipeline is designed to reliably handle high-volume, raw data extracted from the GitHub Events API. Using PySpark ensures scalability and speed in processing millions of records daily before they are stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

- Processing and Storing: Data from GCS is cleaned and loaded into BigQuery using PySpark, enabling secure, centralized storage optimized for analytics. BigQueryâ€™s architecture allows for fast querying and seamless integration with downstream tools for analysis and visualization.

- Transformations: dbt Cloud facilitates the transformation of data into a star schema, improving query performance and data organization. Creating materialized views on top of the star schema enables quicker and more efficient analysis, reducing processing time for large datasets. The diagram below illustrates the lineage information of dbt:

# Visualization

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data, allowing complex datasets to be easily understood and analyzed. Effective visualizations enable stakeholders to identify trends, patterns, and insights quickly, facilitating informed decision-making; the visualizations for this project are created using Looker.

The visualization above provides key insights into GitHub activity, highlighting several important metrics. It displays the repository with the highest number of commits, offering a clear view of which projects are the most actively developed. Additionally, it illustrates the distribution of various types of Git events, helping users understand the nature of interactions on the platform. The visualization further reveals the trend in the number of commits during the first ten days of the month, showcasing patterns in user engagement. Lastly, it effectively distinguishes between bot accounts and real user accounts, providing valuable context on the authenticity of contributions within the data.

# Performance Optimization

In the GitHub Archive Data Engineering and Analytics project, performance optimization plays a crucial role in ensuring the efficient processing and analysis of vast datasets. By leveraging advanced technologies such as PySpark for data ingestion and processing, we enhance the pipeline's ability to handle millions of records daily with speed and scalability.

To further optimize performance, we utilize Google BigQuery's capabilities, which are designed for fast querying and high concurrency, allowing users to analyze large volumes of data without significant delays. The implementation of dbt Cloud facilitates the transformation of data into a star schema, which streamlines queries and improves data organization. Additionally, the creation of materialized views based on the star schema ensures that analytical queries are executed swiftly, reducing processing time and enhancing overall responsiveness.

By focusing on these optimization strategies, the project not only meets the demands of high data volumes but also delivers timely insights that empower stakeholders to make informed decisions efficiently.

# Summary

The GitHub Archive Data Engineering and Analytics project aims to convert vast amounts of raw GitHub event data into actionable insights regarding platform usage and activity trends. By developing a robust data pipeline using technologies like PySpark and Google Cloud Platform, the project efficiently captures, processes, and analyzes millions of user interactions and repository contributions daily. The architecture incorporates Terraform for infrastructure management and Prefect for workflow orchestration, ensuring streamlined data processing. Visualization tools such as Looker are employed to provide clear insights into user engagement, active repositories, and trends in commits, enhancing decision-making capabilities for stakeholders. Overall, the project emphasizes performance optimization to handle large datasets effectively while delivering timely and meaningful analytics
